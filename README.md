Complex NPC social system to bring a bit more life to the characters
- Appearance: Based on what the character is. For instance, a human might have long, silky, red hair but a lizard probably wouldn't.
- Personality: NPCs have personalities that affect the way they see the world around them. Hopefully, this will lead to dialogue that changes depending on who is talking to whom.
- Knowledge: Just because an NPC meets you doesn't mean it knows everything about you, or any other NPC. Every interaction comes with the chance to learn more about the other person.
- Attraction: Each character has a set of likes and loves, and anyone who meets the criteria is put into the slot. Your character has red hair? That NPC of their likes you a bit more because of it, and that guy over there who hates gingers hates you. This applies to both appearance and personality.
- Disguises: Don't want to be recognized? Disguises present a whole new ID to an investigating character, allowing you to move around without anyone finding you out. Just make sure it's a good disguise, or they'll see through it.
